# Small bottle holder
The idea behind this bottle holder is that you don't need to glue it. It is created using 3 mm thick material.
(currently only concept exists - photos will follow)

Here are the steps to make it:
1. Slide the left and right wall onto the back wall.
2. Put the lid teeth into the rond holes in the wall.
3. Slide the bottom into the side walls, make sure the back tooth nicely fits into the hole
4. Slide the panel with the holes in (it's keeping the vials in place)
5. Slide on the front wall, this should keep everything together.
